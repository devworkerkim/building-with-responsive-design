# Building With Responsive Design

This is the repo for the Building With Responsive Design project in the HTML And CSS course of The Odin Project.  The project is the recreate The Next Web webpage and include a responsrive design such that the page's look changes as the size of the window changes.

## What I Learned

### Mobile First

I thought I would give mobile first design a try since I usually start my responsive design with desktop first.  The video [Are you writing responsive CSS the wrong way?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ohtVzCSHqs) from the lesson brought up some good points about doing mobile first instead of desktop first.  I thought I would give it a try and see how the CSS turned out.
